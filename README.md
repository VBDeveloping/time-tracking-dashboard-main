# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard solution

## Overview

### The challenge

This is a time tracking dashboard project, developed as part of a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw). The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that displays time tracking data for different activities (work, play, etc.) with a specific period selection (daily, weekly, and monthly).

The project is responsive and was built with the following technologies:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* **Data:** The time data is provided by a local `data.json` file, simulating an API call.

## My Process

### Built with

* **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of the page.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling and responsiveness, leveraging **Flexbox** and **Grid** for the layout.
* **JavaScript:** Used for DOM manipulation and dynamic data injection into the page.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in:

* **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript:** I improved my skills in creating, removing, and modifying HTML elements dynamically.
* **Project Architecture:** I practiced organizing code, separating concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which makes the code more scalable and easier to maintain.
* **Responsive Layout:** I reinforced the importance of good layout planning for different screen sizes, using `media queries` effectively.
